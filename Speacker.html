                <p>I am in the process of updating my will and have several questions about the best way to update it. I have two children, one is a hard worker, a family man with three children and a responsible adult. The other is a struggling actor and hasn’t had a steady job in years. I am uncomfortable with continuing to fund the actor’s carefree lifestyle while the money could be going to my grandkids..</p>

                <p> You could also create an irrevocable trust for your son’s benefit. The trust could state the main purpose was to provide for your actor son in retirement or should he wish to buy a home, his health care, and outline a similar set of guidelines for your married son. That way, you are giving them both the same requirements, and the same respect. You could also set up a trust that would account for future grandchildren.</p>
